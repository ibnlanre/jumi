## 2026-09-15 — addressing and motion instances: closed for 1.0

The instance refactor has paid for itself twice over: it is what made the address collision fixable, and
the two defects the fix exposed were both instance-conflation bugs of the kind the refactor exists to
remove. Ruled as follows.

**Structural precedence — accepted.** A control's token is classified against a static vocabulary
(`propertyVariables` plus `effectKeyframes`): a known structural token reads the property scope, anything
else reads the label namespace. The static part is the important part. Classifying against "what this
stylesheet animates" would make `/scale` mean one thing on a page that animates scale and another on a
page that does not, which is unacceptable for an address that authors write down. Measured on the
distinguishing corpus, the collision resolves `1s, 1s` → `1s, 0.4s`: the author's own control wins, so the
collision is resolved rather than renamed internally.

**Compound labels name the whole compound — accepted.** `animate-filter-blur-[4px]/foo` beside
`animation-duration-500/foo` is one `filter` motion at `0.5s`: compound atomicity preserved, and the label
is still useful. The earlier "a member label is discarded" conclusion came from an invalid candidate
(`animate-filter-blur-4` is not a candidate at all — `type: 'length'` against the blur theme), so it never
measured Jumi. `../research/addressing.md` finding 4 and `../research/addressing-instances.md` both carry
the correction.

**One instance derivation — architectural invariant, kept.** No pass may independently reconstruct a
motion instance from activation/label state; all derivation goes through `instanceKeys`. Written up with
its two measurements in `../architecture/instances.md` and enforced by behavioural tests plus a source scan
that fails and names the offending file. This is the item to hold onto: it was always going to drift, and
the second defect was architectural rather than local — two passes answering the same question, one of them
wrong, and the wrong one only appearing to work because of the other bug.

**A broad "nothing reads this token" warning — rejected.**
`motion-safe:animate-fade-in/reveal` beside an unconditional `animation-duration-500/reveal` is a
legitimately latent control, not dead weight. Warnings stay where impossibility is statically provable, and
finding 2 (`contradictory same-address controls`) turns out to be one case that **is not**: two
unconditional control rules writing one variable with different values is also how two elements get
different timings — `animation-duration-300` on cards and `animation-duration-900` on a hero is one
stylesheet, one variable, two values, and no contradiction anywhere. It is provable only *within a single
rule*, which is rare enough to be a typo rather than a pattern, so the contradiction stays where it is
visible: on the element, which is Studio's side of the fence and not the finalizer's. Finding 2's measured
behaviour is unchanged (`1s`), and the reason it is not a rule is unchanged too: CSS guarantees nothing
about authored class order.

**Shadowed/impossible addresses — kept.** Reported rather than dropped, with the remedy in the message.

### Call

> **Consider the addressing/instance work closed for 1.0.** The gate is 17/17, the range checks 43/43, the
> Studio checks 48, and the new browser assertions cover the two failure modes directly — one name a property
> already owns, and candidate order deciding which name wins.

Next: revisit **segment easing**, which had to wait for a motion-instance model that would not contaminate
it. `../architecture/phrases.md` holds the constraint that shaped it: a keyframe's own
`animation-timing-function` cannot be driven by a variable, so per-segment easing is a property of the
keyframe itself. Measured and written up as a proposal in `segment-easing.md` — seven measurements, three
syntax candidates rejected with the property that breaks each, and the suffix form recommended.

## 2026-09-13 — the hoisted shallow-shorthand representation: closed for 1.0

This is enough to close the hoist work.

The production implementation now has the important properties we wanted: the composition detector
reflects the shipped shorthand shape structurally, the slot publication variables are registered
non-inheriting alongside their activation names, `@apply`/variants/pseudos all follow emitted
activation rather than source candidates, and the authentic catalogue preserves **228/228 live
positions with zero differences** while cutting matched-style payload by **57%**. The stylesheet
growing about 10% is acceptable given the tooling/runtime wins measured.

The first flag is the only one I'd treat as process-significant: if `incremental:check` was being
skipped because `pnpm check` short-circuited earlier, make sure the CI output makes individual stages
visible enough that this can't be mistaken for "everything after `test:run` passed." Not necessarily
a redesign, just avoid a green-summary illusion when earlier failures prevent later checks from
running.

I would not require another manual 47s → 2.7s Inspector timing before landing. The authentic CDP
number reproduced within 1.7% of the spike, and the live-behavior diff is zero. That is strong enough
evidence that the production implementation is the same shape that produced the human improvement.
Re-check the Inspector manually after deploy as a confidence check, but do not block the code on it.

Annotating `aggregate-representation.md` rather than rewriting it was also the right call. The old
research was not "wrong"; it measured a different hoist and established the cost model that
eventually led to the better one. Preserving that history is useful.

### Call

> **Land the hoisted shallow-shorthand representation. Mark the representation investigation closed
> for 1.0. Keep the CDP/real-page measurement as a permanent regression path. Do not reopen carrier
> placement or element-local vectors unless a new platform primitive changes the constraints.**

And yes, once that is landed, return to View Transitions. We've done enough foundational work on the
animation core that we can explore them without carrying a known DevTools scalability defect
underneath the experiments.
